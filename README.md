# Image Compression using K-Means Clustering
## Motivation of the project

The Internet is loaded up with an enormous amount of data as images.
People upload millions of pictures every day on social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook and cloud storage platforms such as google drive, etc. With such large amounts of data, image compression techniques become important to compress the images and reduce storage space.
In this project, we have performed image compression using K-means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
